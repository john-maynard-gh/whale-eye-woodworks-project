        They arrived each day on time and ended up completing my floor early.  They ripped out carpet in my family room and

        and we could not be happier! From day 1, Murel and his team were always on time, 
        very professional, attentive, and ALWAYS kept us in the loop on what to expect next.

        "Miro and the Whale Eye family were very professional and did an excellent work in our house.  We did a complete bathroom 
        remodeling, including new tile floors, with a glass door shower and a custom shower wall insert.  Water and light 
        fixtures were all also replaced.  It was super convenient for us that the Whale Eye team were taking care most of
         the aspects of the project, since they took care of many of the details.  Anything that was not to our satisfaction, 
         Miro and the team took care of it without any problem.   In more than one occasion we needed to be out of the house 
         and leave the team working, and we did not had any issues.  The only thing I would have done differently is to verify 
         we had all the parts in place before starting the project, because during a few o
        ccasions we were missing parts and it took a few days to have the team back in the house.  
        Would definitely recommend."

        "I gotta say, I'm like everyone else who's visited this review section, 
        you always go to the ONLY review that was totally different from everyone else's review. With that being said, 
        I came across B. Morrish's one star review. I usually find reviews very helpful, but I really couldn't 
        understand what she was trying to say first, because the spelling and grammar was atrocious, I'm sorry. 
        Secondly, I was trying to see through all the contradictions and storyline, I got lost. For this, I'm not sorry. 
        I also have a two prong question.  If the reviewer was capable of doing wiring, sheetrock work, trim and all the 
        "etc's" mentioned, why did they even confer with Whale Eye? Can you come to my house?  I'd like to get a estimate. The 
        reviewer was saying "we" did this and "we" did that, I read "we" so much I thought I was in France!! Anyway, Whale Eye 
        is a very knowledgeable and professional  company whom I've conferred with about different woods in durability, quality 
        of exotic woods. I'm well versed in these woods, being raised in the Northeast where these woods are readily accessible 
        and I must say, it was a pleasure and a "deal maker" with Whale Eye because of their knowledge and experience that we 
        will be constructing a Black Walnut wet bar in my living room. I wouldn't trust anyone else to contract this, being 
        thousands of dollars in wood alone, barked, Black Walnut to be exact. I can't wait! Sorry B. Morrish, I wasn't buying 
        your review.."

        "Whale Eye Woodworks is an AMAZING company!! Miro (owner) replaced my old faucet,  resealed my sink, installed a new 
        ceiling fan & moved the existing ones where I wanted them. He & his colleague Neil also replaced my bedroom carpet with 
        laminate. I'm over the moon THRILLED & with some furniture rearrangement have an entirely new bedroom!! Oh!! And Neil 
        moved our 50' TV as well as putting up our new mailbox!! We will be replacing our kitchen, 
        livingroom, hall & dining area with the same laminate. If things work out on my end, I'll also have a new kitchen by 
        Christmas!! These men are professionals!! They take extreme pride in their work as well as being kind & funny. They work 
        VERY hard & are EXTREMELY timely in their projects. Price wise? I'd put them up against ANYONE!!!

Since moving here 6 years ago, it's been difficult to find ANYONE to do ANYTHING especially if you want QUALITY & done in a 
timely fashion or someone that doesn't want a load of money up front. I could go on & on, but you get my point. Even AFTER 
they finish? If you need some adjustments or find something not to your liking? They're there to make sure their customer is 
happy with the outcome. Whale Eye Woodworks is the BEST & you won't be dissatisfied or disappointed."
